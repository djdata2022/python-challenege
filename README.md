Module 3 challenge due 1/18/23

## PyBank Analysis
This challenge, required the creation of a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using the dataset in budget_data.csv. The dataset was composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task was to create a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


Financial Analysis Results
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)


## PyPoll Analysis
This challenge involved helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

The task was to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
